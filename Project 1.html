                    <p2> From 1580 to 2010 93% of shark attacks worldwide were on men. In Florida the month with the most attacks is September. Sharks normally do not hurt humans, but when they do they usually mistake the human as something else. Also, most of the time the attack is provoked by the human. More people kill sharks than sharks killing people. Sharks are vunerable and will be extinct if people don't stop harming their species. </p2>
